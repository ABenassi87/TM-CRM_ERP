Node.js Config
The items declared and passed to the Node.js application are:

NODE_ENV - the type of environment - development, production, etc. - can be read by the application to do things conditionally (defaults to "config")
PORT - the port that the Node.js application should listen on - should be read by the application and used when starting its server (defaults to "8000")
CONFIG_DIR - used for node-config (defaults to "$APP_DIR"); is required, but should be kept as the default if not needed

Execution Config
The items declared and used by the overall management of executing the application are:

NODE_EXEC - location of the Node.js package executable - useful to set if the executable isn't on your PATH or isn't a service (defaults to $(which node))
APP_DIR - location of the Node.js application directory (defaults to "/opt/framework")
NODE_APP - filename of the Node.js application (defaults to "debug.js")
PID_DIR - location of the PID directory (defaults to "/var/run")
PID_FILE - name of the PID file (defaults to "$PID_DIR/nodeserver.pid")
LOG_DIR - location of the log (Node.js application output) directory (defaults to "/var/log/nodeserver")
LOG_FILE - name of the log file (defaults to "$LOG_DIR/nodeserver.log")
APP_NAME - name of the app for display and messaging purposes (defaults to "ToManage")

1) copy the renamed/modified script(s) to /etc/init.d (chmod 755)
